# chat-app-python
This Python-based chat application uses TCP sockets secured by the TLS protocol to ensure end-to-end encryption. The TLS protocol employs a 2048-bit RSA server key and a digital certificate, both generated with OpenSSL, to authenticate client-server connections. The server key is also used to create a self-signed certificate.

> [!WARNING]
> The installation guide assume you are using a Unix/Linux system. If you're on Windows, please adjust the paths accordingly.
> Additionally, code documentation is not provided for some of the UI classes, as the code is generated by Qt Designer.
> 
> This project requires Python version 3.7+. Using a Python version lower than 3.7 may cause dependencies to become corrupted or fail to install properly.
