# chat-app-python
This Python-based chat application uses TCP sockets secured by the TLS protocol to ensure end-to-end encryption. The TLS protocol employs a 2048-bit RSA server key and a digital certificate, both generated with OpenSSL, to authenticate client-server connections. The server key is also used to create a self-signed certificate.
